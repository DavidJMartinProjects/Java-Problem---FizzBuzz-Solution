# Java Problem - FizzBuzz-Solution

The "Fizz-Buzz test" is an common programming interview question based on the concept of a game where a group of children sit 
around in a group and say each number in sequence, except if the number is a multiple of three (in which case they say “Fizz”) 
or five (when they say “Buzz”). If a number is a multiple of both three and five they have to say “Fizz-Buzz”.

My solution to this problem is enclosed in the FizzBuzz.java file.
